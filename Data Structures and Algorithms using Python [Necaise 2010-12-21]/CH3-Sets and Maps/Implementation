Application: Sales Reports
LazyMart, Inc. is a small regional chain department store with locations in several
different cities and states. The company maintains a collection of sales records for
the various items sold and would like to generate several different types of reports
from this data. One such report, for example, is the yearly sales by store, as
illustrated in Figure 3.10 on the next page, while others could include total sales
across all stores for a specific month or a specific item.
